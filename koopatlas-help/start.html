            <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
                <p>Once there was a giant turtle, on whose back rested the entire world. The turtle was alone, walking through space, for the longest of ages. Time seemed to pass immemorial, before a fiery clothed god came before the turtle. The turtle walked towards the god in wonderment, curious and bewildered. It was then that the fiery clothed god begot a mighty leap, and landed upon the turtle, ricocheting off his back to reach an astounding height.</p>
                <p>The turtle, shocked and frightened by the evil god, retreated into his shell. When the god came down from the heavens, he landed once more upon the turtle's shell, and the force was such that the turtle shot away from his feet, spinning at an incredible speed, so quickly that he could not slow down, and could not escape.</p>
                <p>This is the story of the earth, and how it began to rotate around its axis through space. This is the story of Koopatlas.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                        
            <h2><b>Starting Koopatlas!</b></h2>
                <p>If you have a precompiled executable, simply double click. Precompiled executables should be available as a Windows exe, or a Mac application file.</p>
                <p>For those who cannot run one of the available executable files, or who simply desire not to do so, there is a source distribution available. The source distribution requires the following packages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s2"><a href="http://www.python.org/download/"><span class="s3">Python 2.7</span></a></span> or higher (but lower than Python 3.0)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download"><span class="s3">PyQt 4.6</span></a><span class="s4"> or higher</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Windows users can get away with downloading the Windows binary installer for Python and the binary Installer for PyQt, which will hold your hand and install Qt and SIP for you.</p>
                <p>Mac OS X users would be recommended to install PyQt through a package manager such as <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>, and can then run the enclosed python files through the system distributed python.</p>
                <p>Linux users may grab pyqt and python 2.7 through the package manager of their choice.</p>
                <p><br></p>
            
            <h2><b>Creating New Worlds</b></h2>
                <p>Koopatlas begins by creating a blank world for you. Worlds can be any size, and contain several different types of objects. Tiles take a tileset created by Koopuzzle, and work similarly to how tilesets functions in Reggie!, the NSMBWii editor. Doodads are images that can be placed as desired on a map, and animated through scaling, rotation, or translation. Paths and nodes combine to makes the network of levels and roads that Mario can interact with. Together, these elements make a Koopatlas map.</p>
                <p>To add tilesets into Koopatlas, they <b>must</b> be located in the "Tilesets" folder in the same directory as Koopatlas is. Tilesets can be created with Koopuzzle (included in the Koopatlas download) from a 768x384 image, and will have the .arc extension when properly exported. You can find a Photoshop template, including handy Action scripts, <a href="https://mega.nz/file/3mh2xRpA#y8VsYNzTunsh8t2n2EXE4NU6WeqtspWL-FhAQypRWts">here</a>.</p>
                <p>As a helpful resource, we've also made available NewerSMBW's own <a href="https://mega.nz/file/byR30AwA#LNjTvR60UplsC5sV5cEaJae30EgDwsA7o2yAjnVa-Wg">world map</a> and <a href="https://mega.nz/file/nixgTBBQ#-ubzTWaIWK3UwltMt9XbUGkYbdP6X4G8fX32TV4ed8E">tileset</a> data for use with Koopatlas.</p>
