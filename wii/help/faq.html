			<h2 class='spaceOutABit'>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

			<div class='questionContainer'>
				<div class='question'>
					<span class='number'>1. </span>When will Newer be released?
				</div>
				<div class='answer'>
					It's already released. You missed it.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class='questionContainer'>
				<div class='question'>
					<span class='number'>2. </span>Where can I get an ISO of this game? How can I make one?
				</div>
				<div class='answer'>
					We do not support piracy, so we cannot provide links to an ISO of this game or instructions on how to make one. Sorry about that.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class='questionContainer'>
				<div class='question'>
					<span class='number'>3. </span>Can I use any assets made by the Newer Team in my own project?
				</div>
				<div class='answer'>
					Anything you'd like aside from the levels. We would appreciate it if you gave credit, too!
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class='questionContainer'>
				<div class='question'>
					<span class='number'>4. </span>Are you going to make a Newerest SMBW, or a Newer 2?
				</div>
				<div class='answer'>
					We released <i>Newer Super Mario Bros. DS</i> for the Nintendo DS in 2017. You can check that out, as well as our other projects, <a href="/">on the main page.</a> We don't plan to make one ourselves, but if you'd like a similarly ambitious mod for <i>New Super Mario Bros. 2</i>, check out <a href="https://smbnext.net/"><i>Super Mario Bros. Next.</i></a> (We are not affiliated with this project.)

			<div class='questionContainer'>
				<div class='question'>
					<span class='number'>5. </span>Can I still play the original game after installing Newer?
				</div>
				<div class='answer'>
					Of course! Newer is only active when you launch the game through the Riivolution channel. The original game will still be playable from the Disc Channel. Your disc is never modified, and as it happens, your console is physically incapable of doing that in the first place.

			<div class='questionContainer'>
				<div class='question'>
					<span class='number'>6. </span>Why do you like potatoes and onions so much?
				</div>
				<div class='answer'>
					It can only be love.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class='questionContainer'>
				<div class='question'>
					<span class='number'>7. </span>My question is not answered here. How can I get in touch?
				</div>
				<div class='answer'>
					You can drop us an email at admin@newerteam.com.
